The ItemStream interface serves as the contract to be able to periodically store and restore state. Consisting of three methods, open(ExecutionContext ec), update(ExecutionContext ec), and close(), the ItemStream interface is implemented by any stateful component in Spring Batch. In cases, for example, where a file is involved in the input or output, the open(ExecutionContext ec) method opens the required file, and the close() method closes the required file. The update(ExecutionContext ec) method records the current state (number of records written, and so on) as each chunk is completed.

The reason for the difference between CompositeItemWriter and ClassifierCompositeItemWriter is that CompositeItemWriter implements the org.springframework.batch.item.ItemStream interface. In CompositeItemWriter, the open(ExecutionContext ec) method loops through the delegate ItemWriters and calls the open(ExecutionContext ec) method on each of them as required. The close() and update(ExecutionContext ec) methods work the same way.

 However, ClassifierCompositeItemWriter doesnâ€™t implement the ItemStream method. Because of this, the XML file is never opened or XMLEventFactory (or the underlying XML writing) created
